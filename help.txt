Expected the input directory name to be accompanied by these 3 option(­l,­a,­h) in any combination in which case output should reflect the 
effect of these options. 

Eg. Test cases
 
$ ./myls dirname 
dircontent
 
$ ./myls dirname -lh
dircontent with effects of these options
 
$./myls -lah  dirname

Notes:
1. dirname can be absolute or relative path, it can also be a filename, in which case you output that
file only.
2. A symlink is displayed to the file it points to like in the case of ls -l. 
3. Options are given together (like -lah) and not separately (like -a -l) to make parsing easier.
4. Options can be present before or after the dirname
